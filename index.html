        <h1>History of Weather Forecasting</h1>
        <p>The history of weather forecasting is a fascinating tale of human ingenuity and scientific progress, spanning millennia from ancient civilizations to the cutting-edge technology of today. From relying on celestial observations and animal behavior to harnessing the power of computers and satellites, our ability to predict the weather has evolved remarkably. <br>

            <b>Early Weather Forecasting</b> <br>
            
            Our ancestors, deeply connected to nature, sought to understand and predict the weather for survival and agricultural purposes. Ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks, relied on observations of natural phenomena, including cloud patterns, animal behavior, and celestial movements, to make weather forecasts.
            The Babylonians, around 650 BC, were among the first to record weather observations systematically, linking them to astronomical events. They also developed a system of dividing the sky into 12 equal parts, the zodiac, which they believed influenced weather patterns. <br>

            <b>The Scientific Revolution and the Rise of Meteorology</b> <br>

            The Scientific Revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries brought significant advancements in our understanding of the atmosphere and weather. Scientists like Galileo Galilei and Evangelista Torricelli developed instruments to measure atmospheric pressure and temperature, laying the foundation for modern meteorology.
            In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments on electricity and weather, proposing a theory of thunderstorms. His insights paved the way for further investigations into atmospheric electricity and its impact on weather patterns. <br>
    
            <b>Modern Weather Forecasting: A Blend of Science and Technology.</b> <br>

            Today, weather forecasting is a sophisticated science, combining theoretical models, advanced computational power, and a vast network of weather stations and satellites. Meteorologists use NWP models to simulate atmospheric processes and predict weather patterns, while continuous data from various sources is fed into these models to refine and update forecasts. 
            Weather forecasting has become an invaluable tool for various sectors, including aviation, agriculture, transportation, and emergency preparedness. Accurate forecasts help mitigate weather-related hazards, protect property and lives, and optimize resource allocation.

            <h2>1. Doppler radar</h2>
            <img class="methods-img" src="/images/doppler-radar.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <b>Doppler Radar is the meteorologist’s window into observing severe storms. With 159 radar towers across the United States, NOAA’s National Weather Service has comprehensive coverage of the continental U.S. and partial coverage of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam. Doppler radar detects all types of precipitation, the rotation of thunderstorm clouds, airborne tornado debris, and wind strength and direction.</b>

            <img class="methods-img" src="/images/satelite.png" alt="">
            <p>
                <b>Weather Satellites monitor Earth from space, collecting observational data our scientists analyze. NOAA operates three types of weather satellites. Polar orbiting satellites orbit the Earth close to the surface, taking six or seven detailed images a day. Geostationary satellites stay over the same location on Earth high above the surface taking images of the entire Earth as frequently as every 30 seconds. Deep space satellites face the sun to monitor powerful solar storms and space weather. NOAA also uses data from satellites operated by other agencies and countries.</b>

            <img class="methods-img" src="/images/radiosondes.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                <b>Radiosondes are our primary source of upper-air data. At least twice per day, radiosondes are tied to weather balloons and are launched in 92 locations across the United States. In its two hour trip, the radiosonde floats to the upper stratosphere where it collects and sends back data every second about air pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction. During severe weather, we usually launch weather balloons more frequently to collect additional data about the storm environment.</b>

                <b>NOAA’s Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputer System (WCOSS) is the backbone of modern forecasting. With 5.78 petaflop computing capacity it can process quadrillions of calculations per second. Our supercomputers are almost 6 million times more powerful than your average desktop computer. Observational data collected by doppler radar, radiosondes, weather satellites, buoys and other instruments are fed into computerized NWS numerical forecast models.

            <p>
                <b>AWIPS (NOAA’s Advanced Weather Information Processing System) is a computer processing system that combines data from all the previous tools into a graphical interface that our forecasters use to analyze data and prepare and issue forecasts, watches, warnings. This system uses NOAA supercomputers to process data from doppler radar, radiosondes, weather satellites, ASOS, and other sources using models and forecast guidance products. After meteorologists prepare the forecasts, AWIPS generates weather graphics and hazardous weather watches and warnings. All this helps our meteorologists create more accurate forecasts and faster than ever before.</b>

        <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations
            in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people
            enjoy peace and prosperity.
            The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that
            development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to
            end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
            The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the
            SDGs in every context.
